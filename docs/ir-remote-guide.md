- **Optimal range**: 1-5 meters (3-15 feet)
- **Angle**: Point directly at the robot's IR receiver
- **Line of sight**: Ensure no obstacles between remote and robot

### Battery Care

- Use fresh AAA batteries for best signal strength
- Remove batteries if not using for extended periods
- Replace batteries when response becomes sluggish

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No response | Check batteries, ensure robot is powered on |
| Intermittent response | Move closer, check for IR interference |
| Wrong commands executed | Reset robot, re-sync remote |
| Delayed response | Replace batteries |
